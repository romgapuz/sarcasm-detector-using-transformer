# Sarcasm Detection using Transformer Encoder and Attention

This project implements a sarcasm detection model using PyTorch's Transformer Encoder architecture and attention mechanism. The model is trained on the LLM-generated dataset to classify text as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

This project is based on the article and code found here https://debuggercafe.com/text-classification-using-transformer-encoder-in-pytorch/.
